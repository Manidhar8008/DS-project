## 📊 Datasets
- **Manidhar_Lookalike.csv**: Simulated customer + transaction dataset.

## 📈 Techniques Used
- Feature Engineering (total spend, frequency, etc.)
- K-Means Clustering
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Silhouette Score: `0.489`
  - Davies-Bouldin Index: `0.731`
  - Inertia: `248.57`

## 🖼️ Visualizations
- Cluster scatterplots
- PCA-reduced cluster plots

## 📁 Files
